# 3D Shape

This project is a simple Three.js setup that renders an animated 3D icosahedron with both solid and wireframe materials. The scene includes orbit controls for interactive viewing and a hemisphere light for illumination.<br>

##Features
-- Three.js-powered 3D rendering<br>
-- Interactive camera controls with OrbitControls<br>
-- Animated icosahedron with both solid and wireframe rendering<br>
-- Basic lighting using HemisphereLight<br>
-- Responsive to window dimensions<br>

## Usage
-- Clone the repository.<br>
-- Open index.html in a browser.<br>

## Explanation of Components
-- Renderer: Uses WebGLRenderer to draw the scene.<br>
-- Camera: Uses PerspectiveCamera to create a 3D perspective.<br>
-- Scene: The 3D space where objects are placed.<br>
-- Geometry: Creates an icosahedron shape.<br>
-- Materials: Applies both MeshStandardMaterial and MeshBasicMaterial for different visual effects.<br>
-- Lights: Adds a HemisphereLight for ambient illumination.<br>
-- Controls: Enables user interaction with OrbitControls.<br>
-- Animation Loop: Continuously updates and renders the scene.<br>
